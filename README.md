### Exercise 1: Classification 
The Iris Data set was created by R.A. Fisher and is perhaps the best known data set to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisherâ€™s paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.

#### <ins>Task</ins>: 
Using the prescriptive method of conducting classification problems, create one Python note- book that classifies this dataset utilizing the following models:
* K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Naive Bayes
* Logistic Regression

### Exercise 2: Regression
Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great in- terest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.

#### <ins>Task</ins>:
Using the prescriptive method of conducting regression problems, create one Python note- book that predicts the count of casual users (feature casual), count of registered users (feature registered), and the total count of both causal and registered users (feature cnt). Use the multi-regression model and comment your notebook.
