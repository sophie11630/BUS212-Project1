##### Exercise 1: Classification 
The Iris Data set was created by R.A. Fisher and is perhaps the best known data set to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisherâ€™s paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.

<ins>Task</ins>: Using the prescriptive method of conducting classification problems, create one Python note- book that classifies this dataset utilizing the following models:
**K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
**Naive Bayes
**Logistic Regression
